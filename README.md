# Dice Simulation in Java

## Overview
This Java project simulates rolling one or more dice with a configurable number of sides and trials. It calculates and displays statistical data, including the mean, variance, and standard deviation, along with a visual histogram representing the frequency distribution.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

dice-simulation/ <br>
│ <br>
├── src/ <br>
  │ ├── Dice.java <br>
  │ ├── DiceSimulation.java <br>
  │ ├── SimulationResult.java <br>
  │ ├── Statistics.java <br>
  │ ├── Main.java <br>
  │ <br>
└── README.md <br>

## Features
- **Customizable Dice Simulation**: Set the number of sides on the dice and the number of rolls.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate and display mean, variance, and standard deviation.
- **Histogram Output**: Visual representation of frequency distribution using histograms.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular code with separation of concerns.
- **Builder Pattern**: Simplifies the configuration and creation of simulations.

## Requirements
- **Java 8** or later.

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
